The QueryBuilder class is a comprehensive JavaScript utility designed to help construct and manage SQL queries in a programmatic and chainable way. It abstracts the complexity of SQL syntax by providing a fluent API, allowing developers to build queries using JavaScript methods rather than writing raw SQL strings. The class is highly extensible, supporting a wide range of SQL operations, including Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Manipulation Language (DML), Data Query Language (DQL), and Data Control Language (DCL) commands.

Upon instantiation, QueryBuilder receives a language class (which defines the SQL dialect or backend) and optional configuration options. It initializes various internal properties, such as the current query result, error tracking, a map for managing multiple query threads, and a proxy handler that enables method chaining and dynamic error handling. The proxy intercepts method calls, allowing the class to queue operations and manage asynchronous execution flows, which is particularly useful for building complex queries step by step.

The class provides methods for all major SQL operations: creating and dropping databases, schemas, tables, types, domains, and views; managing roles and permissions; and constructing SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements. It also supports advanced SQL features like JOINs, UNIONs, INTERSECTs, EXCEPTs, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY, LIMIT, and OFFSET. Each method typically delegates the actual SQL string generation to the provided language class, ensuring compatibility with different SQL dialects.

A notable feature is the support for "threads," which allows multiple independent query chains to be managed within a single QueryBuilder instance. This is useful for scenarios where you need to build and execute several queries in parallel or switch contexts without creating new instances. The class also includes utility methods for creating columns, expressions, and handling SQL functions (like COUNT, SUM, etc.), as well as cursor management for advanced database operations.

Error handling is integrated throughout the class, with errors being tracked and optionally thrown based on the configuration. The class is designed to be used in asynchronous workflows, with many methods returning promises or supporting async/await patterns. Overall, QueryBuilder provides a robust, flexible, and developer-friendly interface for building and executing SQL queries in JavaScript applications.
